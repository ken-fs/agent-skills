# Feynman Technique

Apply the full Feynman learning technique to deeply understand a concept.

## Instructions

Work through all four steps of the Feynman technique. Be honest about gaps—they're the point.

### Output Format

**Concept**: [What are we trying to understand?]

---

## Step 1: Explain It Simply

*Explain as if teaching someone with no background in this field*

### Simple Explanation

[Write a plain-language explanation. Use everyday words. Avoid jargon. Aim for a bright 12-year-old to understand.]

### Analogy

[Create an analogy using something familiar to illustrate the concept]

---

## Step 2: Identify Gaps

*Where did the explanation get fuzzy, hand-wavy, or require jargon?*

### Gaps Found

| Gap | What I Said | What I'm Not Sure About |
|-----|-------------|------------------------|
| 1 | [vague part] | [the underlying question] |
| 2 | [vague part] | [the underlying question] |
| 3 | [vague part] | [the underlying question] |

### Jargon Used

| Term | Can I Explain It Simply? |
|------|-------------------------|
| [term] | Yes / No / Partially |

---

## Step 3: Fill the Gaps

*Research or think through each gap*

### Gap 1: [Topic]
- **The question**: [What wasn't clear?]
- **The answer**: [What I learned]
- **Now I can explain it as**: [Simple version]

---

## Step 4: Refined Explanation

*Rewrite the complete explanation with gaps filled and simpler language*

### Final Simple Explanation

[The improved, complete explanation in plain language]

### Improved Analogy

[A refined or new analogy that better captures the concept]

### Key Takeaways

1. [Core insight 1]
2. [Core insight 2]
3. [Core insight 3]

**Test Question**
If someone asked me to explain this in 30 seconds, I'd say:

## Step 5: Save to Feishu (Optional)

After completing your Feynman learning session, you can automatically save your notes to Feishu Bitable for long-term knowledge management.

### Self-Assessment

Before saving, please evaluate your understanding:

**掌握程度** (Mastery Level): [1-5 stars]
- ⭐ (1 star): Just encountered, barely understand
- ⭐⭐ (2 stars): Have basic concept, but can't apply
- ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars): Understand core concept, can apply simply
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars): Deep understanding, can solve problems independently
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars): Expert level, can teach others

**学习时长** (Learning Duration): [How many minutes did this take?]

**完成状态** (Completion Status):
- 🟡 学习中 (Still learning)
- 🟢 已掌握 (Mastered)
- 🔵 需复习 (Need review)
- 🟠 待深入 (Need deep dive)

**待深入问题** (Remaining Questions):
[Any deeper questions you want to explore later?]

### Auto-Save to Feishu

Now I'll save your learning notes to Feishu Bitable with:
- ✅ Automatic categorization (AI-powered)
- ✅ Keyword extraction
- ✅ Review reminder calculation (based on forgetting curve)
- ✅ Full learning progress tracking

The system will:
1. Extract key information from your Feynman notes
2. Auto-categorize based on content (frontend, backend, algorithms, etc.)
3. Calculate next review date using spaced repetition
4. Save to your Feishu knowledge base

**Note**: Make sure you have configured your Feishu credentials. See `references/feishu-setup-guide.md` for setup instructions.

## Guidelines

- Don't pretend to understand—gaps are valuable
- Use analogies from everyday life
- If you need jargon, define it simply
- Shorter is usually better
- The "explain to a child" bar is high—take it seriously
- **NEW**: After completing all steps, your notes will be automatically saved to Feishu for future review
